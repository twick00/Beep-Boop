# Beep-Boop

This program is intended to be similar to the classic programming problem Fizz-Buzz.

## Explanation

When a user enters a number into the text field and presses submit, the program then evaluates every number between 0 and the user inputted number for the following:

* Does it have a 0?
* Does it have a 1?
* Is it a multiple of 3?

In that order.

With each evaluation it over-writes the old number if it finds any of the above to be true and returns the new numbers onto the html page to be viewed.

### Specifications

1. This program should replace all numbers that contain 0 with "Beep!"
    * __Example Input: 0__
    * __Example Output: "_Beep!_"__
2. This program should replace all numbers that contain 1 with "Boop!"
    * __Example Input: 1__
    * __Example Output: "_Boop!_"__
3. This program should replace all numbers that are divisible by 3 with "I'm sorry, _Dave_. I'm afraid I can't do that."
    * __Example Input: 30__
    * __Example Output: "I'm sorry, _Dave_. I'm afraid I can't do that."__
